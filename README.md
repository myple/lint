The myple lint package doesn't ship any dart source code.
To enable `myple lint`,

1. Add it to your dev_dependencies

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  myple_lint: ^0.1.0
```
2. Include the rules into your `analysis_options.yaml`

```yaml
include: package:myple_lint/analysis_options.yaml
```

Done! Happy Coding.
